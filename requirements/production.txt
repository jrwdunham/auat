# These ARE put here because this is a private BitBucket repo that cannot be
# accessed outside of trusted networks. A developer installing the TSBC-NC-AUAT
# might want to install the other dependencies but choose another method for
# installing the following ones:

git+https://jdunham@bitbucket.safetyauthority.ca/scm/nc/document-generator-service.git@develop
git+https://jdunham@bitbucket.safetyauthority.ca/scm/ess/email-sending-service-api.git@develop
git+https://jdunham@bitbucket.safetyauthority.ca/scm/des/delivery-service-api.git@develop

# TODO: remove the "jdunham" from the above.
